## Powershell Configuration in Windows 11

### Wait, Windows Powershell? 
Yes and no. Windows OS ships with Windows Powershell, however you should be using this [Powershell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)

### Why Powershell?
Most developers are familiar with the command line when it comes to working with CLIs, command line tools, linux/unix based systems, etc. Powershell core was designed as a fork of the original Windows PowerShell, and as such includes enhanced features that may ship to Windows PowerShell at a later date.

### Recommended Installation 
If you are a windows user you can download it directly from the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/powershell/9mz1snwt0n5d). Otherwise follow the install guide from the Github [Repo](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).
