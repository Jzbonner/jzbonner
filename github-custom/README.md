## Github Customizations for @Jzbonner

#### Setting up Development Environment 
I have found that using GitHub as your main project management tool makes working with version control in Git that much easier. I have created a custom configuration that I use in my own project builds to setup default labels and milestones for a faster workflow. Please refer to this documentation in order to get setup with the `probots/settings` [here](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/)

#### GitHub Worflow 
I usually setup my `.github` configuration on new project repos, by configuring on the main (i.e. production ready branch) branch; and then create a development focused branch to install dependencies, setup project directory structure, organize environment variables and create basic application functionality.
